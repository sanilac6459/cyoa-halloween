# Go in
You went inside the house where Savannah treats with cookies and milk.  

She decided to tell you about how her husband had died three years ago, along with the struggles and life experiences she encountered.  

After about an hour or so, she got her purse and gave you $20. Even though you didn't candy, at least you got money.  

She gave you the money to let you know how much she appericated you listening to her story and keep her company since she's lonely every day.  

As soon as you left her house, you felt bad of how everything turned out for Savannah. You decided to make a promise to visit her every weekend
and keep her company. :)
