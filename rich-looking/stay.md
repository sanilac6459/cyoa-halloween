# You stayed

You stayed hoping to get lots of candy from the Hernandez's.

While walking to the doorstep, a dog from across the street came charging at you!

Before you can even make a move to run, the bites your leg.

Screaming in terror as you see blood dripping down your leg!

You're injured badly and ended up in the hospital.
