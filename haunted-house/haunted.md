# Poor house
You approached to a shabby wooden house where an elderly woman, Savannah Johnson, lives.

Since there's two houses left in this journey, you decided to leave the best one for last which is the haunted house,
although the vibes there is creeping you out and keeps you away from it for now.  

You knocked on her door. When she opened the door, you said "Trick or Treat!"  

She smiles at you fondly and wants to invite you to come inside.
