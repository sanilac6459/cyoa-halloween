# Haunted House 
You approached to a haunted house where an elderly woman, Savannah Johnson, lives.

Although the vibes there is creeping you out, it's the only house left, you decided to visit it before you end your night. 

You knocked on her door. When she opened the door, you said "Trick or Treat!"  

She smiles at you fondly and wants to invite you to come inside.
