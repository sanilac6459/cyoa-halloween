# You go in
You went inside the house where Savannah treats with cookies and milk. The inside of the house doesn't look as creepy as it does on the outside. The inside in fact gives off a heartwarming feeling like a cozy home. 

You decided to politely ask about why the outside of the house isn't in the best condition. She decided to tell you about how her husband had died three years ago, leaving her behind with this house. Without much money or help, you couldn't help it but leave the house looking the way it is. She also shares some of her struggles and life experiences she had encountered.

After about an hour or so, she got her purse and gave you $10. She told you that she didn't have candies at home, but she hopes you can use the money to treat yourself with some on your way home. 

She also let you know how much she appreciated for listening to her stories and keeping her company since she been quite lonely.

As soon as you left her house, you felt bad of how everything turned out for Savannah. You decided to make a promise to her that you will visit her every weekendand keep her company. ðŸ˜Š

Walking down the block, you ended your halloween night on a good note and also looking forward to see her again next week!  

The End!
