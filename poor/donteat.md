# Don't eat
You decided to trust your first instinct and chose to not eat the candy that was giving off a weird smell.

You carefully observe the candy and notice that the expiration date was 2 years ago! You give out a small sigh of relief since you had just avoided yourself from food poisoning. 

As you leave the poor house, you notice that there was only one house left for you to visit which is the haunted house. You heard many different rumors about that house from your friends. 

This is your best chance to explore and visit the house to see things with your own eyes. Are you going to visit the haunted house?   

Come on, don't be a scaredy-cat!
