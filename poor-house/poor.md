# Poor House 
There are only two houses left for you to visit. The haunted house is one of them is one of them, but since it's giving off a creepy vibe you decided to visit the poor house first. 

You approached to a poor house where an woman called Emelia Plum lives. 

You knocked on the door, and you were greeted by her. It wasn't a friendly greet, it looks almost like she was annoyed that you came. She quickly tossed a candy at you and close the door on you. 

You picked up the candy, and it gives off a weird smell.
