# Eat the candy
You decided to eat the candy with a weird smell. Soon you got a bad stomach from it. You were able to call the hospital to ask for help, and they came just in time. 

In the hospital, you were told that the candy was so expired that it caused you to have a bad stomach.   

You thought to yourself that you should have trusted your first instinct which was to not eat it.  

Well, guess your halloween night didn't turn out to excited and fun the way you thought it would be.  

Hopefully you get better soon and next year would be better!
