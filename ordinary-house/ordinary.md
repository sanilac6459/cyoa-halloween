After getting chased out of the Hernandez's family's property, You hopefully walk towards the ordinary house. You had no choice but to hope that the ordinary house has decent candies since it was the second house to expect good candies from.

You reached the house. The Smith's open the door to your knock. 

Unfortunately, they had no more candy left, so they tried to settle it with a bad joke and a bad trick.

Well, it left you feeling cringed. You also got sad because you got no candies.

[You decided to check the next house.](../poor-house/poor.md)
