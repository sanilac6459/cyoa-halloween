# Ordinary House

After getting chased out of the Hernandez's family's property, You hopefully walk towards the ordinary house. You had no choice but to hope that the ordinary house has decent candies since it was the second house to expect good candies from.

You reached the house. The Smith's open the door to your knock. 

Unfortunately, they had no more candy left. However, they tried to settle it with a joke, which didn't turn out be hilarious but you laughed along anyway just to be polite.  

You left the Smith's house, feeling cringed and sad because you got no candies.  

You decided third time is the charm and went to the third house.
