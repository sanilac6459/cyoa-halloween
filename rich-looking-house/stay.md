# You stayed

You stayed hoping to get lots of candy from the Hernandez's.

While walking to the doorstep, a dog from across the street came charging at you!

Before you can even make a move to run, the dog bites your leg.

Screaming in terror as you see blood dripping down your leg!

You're injured badly and ended up in the hospital. What a great place to be on Halloween.  

Well, at least you're still alive. Hopefully you get discharged soon!
