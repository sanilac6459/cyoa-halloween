# Rich-looking House

You start off the night walking through block, until you saw the most expensive house.

This is where the Hernandez's family lives, you've heard that they're really rich. 

Oh boy, this house definitely gives out a lot of candy and the best ones indeed!

The Hernandez's are currently giving out candy from their doorstep.

Walking up to the house, you accidentally stepped on their lawn. This signaled the water sprinkler to spray everywhere!

The Hernandez's saw this and immediately yelled at you for making a mess on their lawn.
